# Interview Questions
## What is express ?
## What are Middlewares functions and How to use them ?
Express is actually a series of middleware function calls 
Middlewares functions are those function which  have access of request object , response object , and next middleware function in request response cycle> If you are using a middleware function  and your middleware function is not ending the request response cycle then pou have to call `next ` to pass the control to the next middleware or to response. If you will not do that then your  request will be left hanging 
### Types of Middleware:
### 1. Application level middleware :

You can bind these application level middleware using `app.use()` and  `app.METHOD() `where METHOD function HTTP method of the request that middleware function handle   

`app.use(middlewareFunction)`- this middleware function will be executed every time the app receive a request beacuse no mount path is provided here 


`app.use('/user/:id',middlewareFunction)`- here a middleware function is mounted on a specific path so the function will execute for any HTTP reuest on  /user/:id path. 


`app.get('/user/:id',middlewareFunction)`- here a middleware function will execute only when  you receive a get request on this path 


`app.use(path,middlewareFunction1,middlewareFunction2)` and 
`app.use(path,[middlewareFunction1,middlewareFunction2])`- here both the middleware function will be called for every request on this path (remember that you have to mention next in both the middlewareFunction1 and middlewareFunction2)

Route handlers enable you to define multiple routes for a path. The example below defines two routes for GET requests to the /user/:id path. The second route will not cause any problems, but it will never get called because the first route ends the request-response cycle.
````javascript
app.get('/user/:id', (req, res, next) => {
  console.log('ID:', req.params.id)
  next()
}, (req, res, next) => {
  res.send('User Info')
})

// handler for the /user/:id path, which prints the user ID
app.get('/user/:id', (req, res, next) => {
  res.send(req.params.id)
})
````
To skip the rest of the middleware functions from a router middleware stack, call next('route') to pass control to the next route. NOTE: next('route') will work only in middleware functions that were loaded by using the app.METHOD() or router.METHOD() functions.
````javascript
app.get('/user/:id', (req, res, next) => {
  // if the user ID is 0, skip to the next route
  if (req.params.id === '0') next('route')
  // otherwise pass the control to the next middleware function in this stack
  else next()
}, (req, res, next) => {
  // send a regular response
  res.send('regular')
})

// handler for the /user/:id path, which sends a special response
app.get('/user/:id', (req, res, next) => {
  res.send('special')
})
````
### 2. Router-level middleware :
Router middleware workd in the same way the application router works but they are bind to the instance of `express.Router()` that is router object.
You can load them using router.use() or router.METHOD().
You have to mount the router in your app like `app.use("/",router)` or `app.use(router)` .
### 3. Error-handling middleware:
rror-handling middleware always takes four arguments. You must provide four arguments to identify it as an error-handling middleware function. Even if you donâ€™t need to use the next object, you must specify it to maintain the signature. Otherwise, the next object will be interpreted as regular middleware and will fail to handle errors.
````javascript
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack)
  res.status(500).send('Something broke!')
})
````
### 4. Built-in middleware:
Express has the following built-in middleware functions:

express.static serves static assets such as HTML files, images, and so on.
express.json parses incoming requests with JSON payloads.  
express.urlencoded parses incoming requests with URL-encoded payloads. 

### 5. Third-party middleware:
You can use third party middleware to enhance express functionality
